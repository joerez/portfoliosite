          <p>Skedge is a full stack React application that helps businesses grow as they schedule appointments.</p>
          <p>It's front end technologies are react and redux.</p>
          <p>Skedge is a personal project with the potential to become a fully fledged Software as a Service once it's complete.</p>
          <p>Along designing, coding, and shipping the entire Front end, I also did a bit of the back end, Including setting up the authentication, and creating different envirements for production and development.</p>
          <p>To date, it's my most ambitious personal project. I'm collaboratng with another full stack engineer that focuses more on the backend of the application, while I work on the front end.</p>

            <p>Out of all of my projects, 2b2t.online gets the most traffic. (1000+ a week)</p>
            <p>2b2t.online was built for a small community of gamers on a Minecraft server. The problem they had was that there were tons of different creations, but nobody knew where they were</p>
            <p>I created 2b2t.online to solve that problem, by giving users a way to record coordinates of different places for others to find.</p>
            <p>2b2t.online also serves the community as a Wiki, and a social network.</p>
            <p>I also built up a team of dedicated moderators to keep the content clean.</p>
            <p>It was developed with MongoDB, Express, Handlebars for templating, and NodeJS.</p>

            <p>Originally, CodingForKids was the name of the program I started, where I taught Elementary aged students basic front end development. It was also where I started my career in coding.</p>
            <p>Before moving to San Francisco, I was teaching in seven different Elementary schools in the East Bay area.</p>
            <p>Eventually I transitioned CodingForKids into an application that gives CS Majors the ability to tutor students and make extra money on the side</p>
            <p>I was the sole developer for this, and used MongoDB, Express, Handlebars for templating, and Node. I also designed, coded, and shipped everything from scratch.</p>
            <p>Transitioned into a Progressive Web App (PWA) by using service workers that cache all the images, javascript, css, etc. which allows users to load the page while completely offline.</p>

          <p>Office Bubbles is a game about nothing and as such, it has no set goals or accomplishments. It's designed to keep you mindlessly entertained while at your desk.</p>
          <p>It might even sort of look like you're doing work.</p>
          <p>I developed Office Bubbles as a Single Page Application using React and React Router, as well as Canvas.</p>
          <p>For several months I began playing around with and developing interactive hero sections on homepages. I would spend more time than I'm proud of playing around on these. Eventually, this lead to the thought that maybe, just maybe, other people would enjoy playing around with them too.</p>
          <p>The idea for Office Bubbles came to me one evening, and I spent the next 8 hours designing, coding, and shipping it.</p>

            <p>Collaborated with Designers to create the UI and Frontend from scratch. This was done by the designers giving Figma designs, and I would turn them into HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used Pug for templating, and sent data from a MongoDb using JSON.</p>

          <p>In my youth, I really enjoyed flash games and especially loved becoming an  active part of the communities there.</p>
          <p>One of my favorite games was EpicDuel, an MMO flash RPG where players could create strategic builds and battle other players.</p>
          <p>The best part of this game was the community that formed with it.</p>
          <p>Since flash is dying off, the community of EpicDuel is too. I asked the community if they would like a place to record stories about their friends and groups, to stand the time of history.</p>
          <p>EpicDuelStories was made to preserve the legacy of EpicDuel players. I also built up a nice moderation team to filter content</p>
          <p>I built EpicDuelStories on the MEHN stack, and designed it with custom CSS and the Materialize library.</p>

            <p>2b2t.reviews was the first full stack web application I created. While it isn't my best work, I chose to include it here because it taught me some important lessons, and to have provide context for how much my skills have improved since building my first web app</p>
            <p>2b2t.reviews was built to add accountability to Minecraft players. It allows users to leave reviews on other players, to see if they are trustworthy.</p>
            <p>The intention was the create a track record of any negative histories players may have built up on a specific server.</p>
            <p>After it's creation, it was attacked viciously by malicious users, and these attacks forced me to learn how to protect my web applications from various types of exploits.</p>

          <p>For one of my websites, I wanted to create a 3D book, and I couldn't find any free libraries that I could use to help me.</p>
          <p>I decided that I would have to create my own 3D book from scratch, and then I turned it into a library for other developers to use.</p>
          <p>Flipbook.js books are 100% customizable. Developers have the ability to style these books with any rules they deem necessary.</p>
          <p>The framework handles the rest by adding functionality. It also comes with default styles.</p>

            <p>The idea came to me that it wasn't easy to know when other classes started and ended at the school I went to. This lead to the idea of creating a New Tab for makeschool students and staff, that could help their productivity.</p>

          <p>I compiled several different MERN stack applicaitons single page applications I've built, and created the perfect boiler plate to get started.</p>
          <p>This let's you quickly set up a MERN stack Single Page Application, with built in Google oAuth, and a proxy between the front and back end.</p>

            <h1>React Transitions</h1>
            <p>Many single page web applications don't use transitions for their different routes.</p>
            <p>React Transitions hopes to change that.</p>
            <p>Even though this library was built with React and react-router in mind, it actually works with anything, and in the end, it's just a CSS Animation library.</p>
            <p>This means that you are free to use this with Angular, VanillaJS, really anything.</p>
            <p>All you have to do is add some class names to pages you want to have transitions on.</p>
            <p>The big difference between this and any other animation library, is that these transitions are designed for transitioning full pages. Not single elements.</p>
