          <p>Skedge is a full stack React application that helps businesses grow as they schedule appointments.</p>
          <p>It's front end technologies are react and redux.</p>
          <p>Skedge is a personal project with the potential to become a fully fledged Software as a Service once it's complete.</p>
          <p>Along designing, coding, and shipping the entire Front end, I also did a bit of the back end, Including setting up the authentication, and creating different envirements for production and development.</p>
          <p>To date, it's my most ambitious personal project. I'm collaboratng with another full stack engineer that focuses more on the backend of the application, while I work on the front end.</p>

            <p>Out of all of my projects, 2b2t.online get's the most traffic. (600+ a week)</p>
            <p>2b2t.online was built for a small community of gamers on a Minecraft server. The problem they had was that there were tons of different creations, but nobody knew where they were</p>
            <p>I created 2b2t.online to solve that problem, by giving users a way to record coordinates of different places for others to find.</p>
            <p>2b2t.online also serves the community as a Wiki, and a social network.</p>
            <p>I also built up a team of dedicated moderators to keep the content clean.</p>
            <p>It was developed with MongoDB, Express, Handlebars for templating, and NodeJS.</p>

          <p>Woah.css is an open source CSS Animation Library for eccentric developers.</p>
          <p>I've really enjoyed using other CSS Animation libraries as a student, and I ventured out to create one of my own.</p>
          <p>The results of that became my most popular github repository by far with over 150 stars.</p>
          <p>It trended on Github and was the  top post of March, 2018 on Reddit’s Frontend subreddit.</p>
          <p>You can install woah.css through npm or bower as well. It was my first published npm package.</p>

            <p>Originally, CodingForKids was the name of the program I started, where I taught Elementary aged students basic front end development. It was also where I started my career in coding.</p>
            <p>Before moving to San Francisco, I was teaching in seven different Elementary schools in the East Bay area.</p>
            <p>Eventually I transitioned CodingForKids into an application that gives CS Majors the ability to tutor students and make extra money on the side</p>
            <p>I was the sole developer for this, and used MongoDB, Express, Handlebars for templating, and Node. I also designed, coded, and shipped everything from scratch.</p>
            <p>Transitioned into a Progressive Web App (PWA) by using service workers that cache all the images, javascript, css, etc. which allows users to load the page while completely offline.</p>

          <h1>Office Bubbles</h1>
          <p>Office Bubbles is a game about nothing and as such, it has no set goals or accomplishments. It's designed to keep you mindlessly entertained while at your desk.</p>
          <p>It might even sort of look like you're doing work.</p>
          <p>I developed Office Bubbles as a Single Page Application using React and React Router, as well as Canvas.</p>
          <p>For several months I began playing around with and developing interactive hero sections on homepages. I would spend more time than I'm proud of playing around on these. Eventually, this lead to the thought that maybe, just maybe, other people would enjoy playing around with them too.</p>
          <p>The idea for Office Bubbles came to me one evening, and I spent the next 8 hours designing, coding, and shipping it.</p>

            <p>HypeCam was a three month paid contract where I worked as the Lead Full stack Web Developer.</p>
            <p>I coded and shipped a Node backend for iOS and web that takes requests from the mobile application and posts shareable videos on the website.</p>
            <p>Collaborated with Designers to create the UI and Frontend from scratch. This was done by the designers giving Figma designs, and I would turn them into HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used Pug for templating, and sent data from a MongoDb using JSON.</p>
            <p>Collaborated with three other developers. Two of whom were iOS engineers and the other was the product manager.</p>
